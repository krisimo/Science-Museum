# Science-Museum# Science Museum Website – CA 1

## Project Overview

This project was created as part of the Cross-Course Assignment (CA 1) during my first semester. The goal was to build a responsive website for a fictional science museum that engages visitors of all ages.

The site includes:
- A hero banner and navigation bar
- Sections for kids, teachers, and researchers
- A responsive layout with CSS media queries
- A design aimed at being accessible and educational

## Built With

- HTML
- CSS
- JavaScript

## What I Would Improve

Since building this project, I’ve learned a lot. If I were to rebuild it today, I would:
- Improve the mobile navigation UX
- Add semantic HTML elements to improve accessibility
- Use more consistent spacing and typography
- Add animations or transitions to make the site feel more dynamic

## What I Learned

- How to structure an accessible and responsive site layout
- The importance of planning content for multiple audiences
- Working with media queries and flexbox/grid for layout

## Reflections

This was one of my first full-page builds, and it taught me a lot about planning, structure, and visual storytelling. It helped set the foundation for future projects where I needed to think like both a designer and developer.
